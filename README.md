MicroService:

A Telegram Bot + Flask Server, ready to deploy on a Linux Server.

Videos can be uploaded to the Servers DB via Telegram, and scheduled / uploaded to Instagram/TikTok or other social media accounts.

There is also an endpoint for immediate uploading to a social media account without using Telegram. This endpoint is used in my Content Generator (private Repo).

User accounts can be created and put into groups, so that scheduling the same posts (with FFMPEG modification - will be added later) can be done at once.

/inference endpoint (or /ai in telegram) for simple inference with any OpenRouter model.
